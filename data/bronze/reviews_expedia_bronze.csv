We could hear conversations from the front desk, which made it feel like we had little privacy. Unfortunately, someone had also left the windows open before our arrival, and we didn’t realize it until later. We stayed for two nights, but both the first night and the following day were very noisy due to loud street noise — people talking and shouting, likely from nearby bars — which made it extremely difficult to relax and sleep. Breakfast was okay, but overall, I had a poor experience and wouldn’t choose to stay here again.",30-09-2025,a125fe202145676ce5235610ad2adca5796be2a1d72b074694177ceb0249efcf,"Dear Shiho, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

My memories of Portugal will be throwing up in a bucket and lying in bed for three days.  Other reviews say the shower is small and I thought they were being too harsh but let me assure you. It is smaller than a cruise ship shower. Just enough space to wet yourself and that’s it. It was also moldy.  The sheets were clean and the room was well maintained. The location is very convenient- that is why I didn’t give this place 1 star. I would not stay here again though. ,16-04-2025,a125fe202145676ce5235610ad2adca5796be2a1d72b074694177ceb0249efcf,"Dear Ronen,We are very sorry that your stay did not go as well as it could have due to the food poisoning you suffered.

From the moment we arrived, the staff were lowkey yet welcoming.

The room was spacious, comfortable, tastefully decorated and had a well-appointed bathroom with quality soap and shampoo in wall dispensers.
