Negative: não me parceria bem limpo. como fiquei 11 noites percebia que quando elas entravam para limiar não levava mais do qie 10 min. não trufavam as toalhas de banho todos os dias e o problema não é a troca mas o fato delas ficarem molhadas por até 3 dias sem trocar. é ruim não ter uma forma de seca las pelo menos. muito barulho da rua à noite e se fechar totalmente a janela fica abafado.","","booking"

"2022-12-26","9.0","","O hotel é bem localizado, próximo de duas estações de metrô, paradas de ônibus, bonde e tram. O deslocamento para quaisquer pontos turísticos é fácil. Na área, há vários restaurantes, bares, lojas... não haverá problema nesse quesito. Achei a área calma, não me incomodei com barulho. Cheguei de carro, e tem estacionamentos próximos. Gostei do café da manhã.

Negative: O hotel fica numa ladeira. Então, se chegar de metrô ou qualquer outro meio de transporte que não te deixe na porta, você terá que subir com suas malas por uma ladeira. Tive problema com o Wi-Fi no meu quarto - ao que parece, o repetidor de sinal que ficava na porta do meu quarto não estava replicando o sinal. Na véspera da minha volta, resolvi desplugar e plugar na tomada, e funcionou normal o Wi-Fi. Pedi auxílio ao pessoal da recepção, disseram que averiguariam, mas, ao ver que a solução que eu mesmo obtive foi simples, me pergunto se alguém se deu ao trabalho de ir lá verificar. O café da manhã, caso você não solicite diariamente troca de alguns produtos, virá repetido todos os dias.","","booking"

Somebody with a great eye has a hand in what goes on here. Huge, and I mean huge, bedroom… total comfort! Seriously magnificent cooked to order breakfasts, fresh fruit & juices. Just down the street from the food markets & a short stroll to all the sights. While it doesn’t have a bar, a total treasure just on the adjoining street is By the Wine wine/tapas bar. What are you waiting for?… just book it ;-)

Negative: Not a huge gripe, but we were in Room 1, right bedside the front desk. Sadly, conversations (not that there were many) at the desk feel like they’re literally taking place in your room. (mgt: Easily sorted by building an in-room lobby?… there’s plenty of space).","","booking"

The rooms are very clean and comfortable. I was unfortunately not feeling well during my stay here so had breakfast in my room and layed in bed all day while my husband and daughter explored, but it was a cozy and comfortable place to stay while not feeling well.

Negative: they indicated that they had a bar and this really isn't true, there was a tiny honor bar cart that was frankly 99% empty which is not a bar per se, nor any in room refrigeration, which prevented even having a few beers or bottle of wine ready for when you want it,  not a big deal but need to remove mention of having a bar as they don't.

"2023-03-31","9.0","","Incredible location, near amazing bars, restaurants, coffee shops as well as public transport. We walked to most places and then decided to get the day pass for public transport to visit some locations that were a bit further away. The staff were lovely, the hotel itself is very clean and we were able to get some gluten free bread for dietary requirements. We asked for a quiet room and so our windows were facing a little backstreet which was lovely and indeed very quiet. The room looked out to an amazing wine bar called By The Wine which is another little gem and perfect for some food and delicious wine. Overall we had an amazing 3 night stay and would definitely come back to this hotel!

Negative: Although we had a quiet room, and there was no street noise, there was lots of moving around and some noise coming from upstairs everyday around 7.30am. It didn't bother us too much as we were up at that time but if you're looking for a longer sleep you might need some ear plugs!","","booking"

There is no lift but we luckily had a ground floor room. Our room was large and perfectly comfortable and clean. A good buffet-breakfast. The staff were helpful and friendly. It is perfectly situated to explore all of Lisbon’s delights being on a short stroll to tram routes (including the famous 28) and a metro station but much that was walkable.

Negative: Nothing really - the constraints of the building were also its character. Not a complaint; Lisbon is a pretty noisy place so we couldn’t open the window at night but the air-con was fine.","","booking"

The location of the hotel was superb, and the staff was really nice and helpful. Rooms were ample and each had an own AC unit, nicely decorated as well! We also liked the use of codes instead of having to carry keys with us.

Negative: Our rooms were in the basement, and after heavy rains it really smelled a bit funky. Additionally, it must've been some strong cleaning soaps that were used, giving the rooms a strong scent as well. The beds were hard, although some people might appreciate that. Our room's huge window was street level where people tended to e.g. lean on and have a smoke in front of it, so we felt like we were in a fishing bowl and needed to keep everything shut during our entire stay.

Negative: As a vegan, the breakfast wasn't really up to par with what I would like to eat in the morning. I ended up eating out most days. However, I completely understand this is a boutique hotel and they can't accommodate everyone.

We wanted a small boutique hotel and this delivered that in bucket loads.  It's a charming place where the staff go over and beyond to be helpful with advice/service to make the stay a little bit more special.  It was my partners' birthday whilst we were there so they gave him a cake to mark the special day - very thoughtful.

Negative: There was nothing I didn't like so these are only minor observations I offer to follow travellers .  The bathroom (to Room 10) could have been a little bigger ( that would be difficult to achieve now without building work) but it was sufficient for our needs.  Note that all the rooms do not have a safe so if this is important guests are asked to let the hotel know in advance.  Our room was towards the back of the hotel overlooking the excellent ('By the Wine' wine bar)  which meant there was some noise late at night  but nothing too distracting. That said I would highly recommend the hotel and we will go back when next in Lisbon.","","booking"

The hotel is very well located within walking distance of many attractions and restaurants. My room was large, comfortable and very well put together. The breakfast buffet was much better than average with exceptionally good fresh fruit and gluten-free bread (I have celiac disease) along with all the other things you would expect. However, what really made this stay memorable for me was the exceptionally friendly  staff at the front desk.  They booked a restaurant for me, gave me lots of great tips on sites to see and walking routes, they helped me book a bus to Porto Covo where I am walking the Rota Vicintina, and they set me up on Uber for a ride to the bus terminal.  Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again.

I did several tours while I was there & it was a short walk to the meeting point of each of them & the train is nearby. There are many restaurants close by. Breakfast includes made to order eggs, fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, meat & cheese, cereals & sweets. It far exceeded my expectations. My room (4) overlooked the street but with the shutters closed I had absolutely no trouble sleeping. (Air conditioning is available in case you get warm.) There is a robe in the room & the bedding was very comfortable. I would not hesitate to recommend this property.

Negative: Breakfast starts at 8, but most tours also start at 8 (or 830 but a short walk is required.) An earlier breakfast or some grab & go options would be great! (I did tell them I was leaving early one morning & they left saltines, a banana & juice outside my door, so they’re definitely trying!)","","booking"

Unsere Suite war geräumig und ansprechend. Das Bad ist geräumig und es fehlt an nichts. Das Personal ist überaus freundlich, zuvorkommend und stets hilfsbereit.

Negative: Um in allen Kategorien ein hervorragend zu vergeben bedarf es unserer Meinung nach nur ein wenig Upgrades. So haben wir auf dem Zimmer einen Kühlschrank vermisst. Dadurch war es uns nicht möglich Getränke zu kühlen. Alternativ hätten wir uns einen Eiswürfelautomaten gewünscht oder den Verkauf von gekühlten Getränken. 
Durch die zentrale Lage war es nachts nicht immer so ruhig wie wir es uns gewünscht hätten. Aber das ist der Preis den man bei dieser zentralen Lage zu zahlen hat.

Negative: La habitacion olia a humedad terriblemente y no se podia ventilar ya que daba a la calle directamente y la ventana no abria. Igualmente el olor estaba en las paredes, suelo, cabecero de cama.
El personal dio largas a la solicitud de cambio de habitacion y decia que tenian que hablar con el jefe, al que nunca vimos porque no aparecio y no nos cambiaron de habitacion. 
Nos fuimos una noche antes, de tres noches pagadas usamos dos, solicitamos el reembolso del dinero de la noche no usada si no nos cambiaban de habitacion, no nos dieron ninguna solucion ni nos devolvieron ni un euro por la noche que nos fuimos porque el olor era horrible.
Una pena de vacaciones en un sitio asi!! no lo recomiendo.
La habitacion que nos dieron fue la numero 12, a la calle, el resto no sé como seran, pero desde luego deberian hacerse cargo si te venden una habitacion con esa peste por 190€ la noche. 
Otra cosa son los pequeños mantenimientos, la ducha no se mantenia, el boton de wc se quedaba pillado, se cortaba toda la luz de la habitacion de repente...

"2024-06-21","9.0","Perfetta sistemazione","Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti e abbiamo trovato la sistemazione molto comoda e centrale per poter visitare la città. A piedi si raggiunge la piazza principale nel quartiere Chiado con tutti i locali e servizi. Lo staff all'hotel è stato davvero molto gentile, professionale e disponibile, non ricordo i nomi ma sia le ragazze che i ragazzi alla reception sono stati TOP. Consigli turistici e pratici per visitare al meglio la città e il Portogallo (visto che per noi Lisbona era la I tappa). La camera da noi scelta andava bene come dimensioni, spazio, pulizia, letto comodissimo, possibilità di farsi un caffè o un tea al rientro, una bottiglia d'acqua sempre a disposizione. Pulizia sia della stanza che degli altri ambienti. Colazione sia dolce che salata, buona qualità e varietà. Alcuni prodotti freschi (tipo frutta/yoghurt) vanno scelti al momento del check-in, ma per noi non è stato un problema. Abbiamo anche richiesto se era possibile anticipare di mezz'ora un giorno la colazione in quanto eravamo diretti a Sintra e tutti molto disponibili e cortesi. All'arrivo e alla partenza consegnano e ritirano loro le valigie in camera. Veramente consigliato. In caso dovessi tornare a Lisbona sceglierò sicuramente questa struttura però forse una camera più grande e non al piano terra.

Negative: Unica nota negativa che la camera si trova a piano terra e si sente un po' di odore di umido entrando, ma bastava lasciare un po' aperto la finestra. Inoltre nelle vicinanze si trova un locale e la sera si sente un po' di rumore e schiamazzi (siamo capiti nella sera in cui il giorno dopo era festa in Portogallo)","","booking"

Negative: The room was a bit damp (there were damp traps under the bed), which I think was responsible for a slightly wierd smell whenever initially entering the room which seemed to disappear. I did wonder if it affected my throat. It was on a down level but also street level.

The wardrobe was a bit wierd and if you hung two tops they would overlap and could hang dresses; but there was also another bar in the room things could kind of be hung on. Would be good to have somewhere to put long floaty summer dresses!

Light wasn't great in the room (or air) as you were on a back street level opposite a wine bar so don't want to invite or let others see in.","","booking"

We went to the hotel with the hope that we could just drop off our luggage and go out for 6 or 7 hours until check-in.  Instead Claudia invited us to the Hotel's breakfast and found us a comfortable space to rest until our room was ready.  Ultimately we were able to check in hours early.  Then Lara at the front desk asked us what we wanted to do in Lisbon and gave us many excellent suggestions.  All the staff were just so caring and friendly.  A great experience!

Negative: Das Hotel ist sehr schlecht isoliert, man hört was die Leute an der Rezeption sagen. Es ist unmöglich zu schlafen, bei offenen Fenster. Die ganze Nacht kommt so viel Lärm von den Bars und der oft befahrenen Straße draußen . Mit dem geschlossenen Fenster stinkt es aber muffig und sehr unangenehm. Die Klimaanlage hat uns auch nicht geholfen, da sie anscheinend nie geputzt wurde. Auch die Luft aus der Klimaanlage riecht muffig und staubig.
Das Badezimmer war voll mit Schimmel, es hat im Zimmer sehr nach Schimmel und Chlor gerochen.

Negative: Das Zimmer war zwar sehr nett und modern eingerichtet, jedoch im Erdgeschoss mit dem stark frequentierten Gehweg unmittelbar vor dem vergitterten Fenster ohne Gardine. Daher musste man ganztägig entweder das Rollo oder die Vorhänge vor das Fenster ziehen, und so ohne Tageslicht auskommen. Wir waren zuerst sehr enttäuscht und fanden es sehr Schade, dass man nicht bei der Buchung darauf hingewiesen wird, z.B. über eine getrennte Zimmmerkategorie für das Erdgeschoss. Die pauschale Beschreibung „dieses charmante, gut beleuchtete Zimmer verfügt über große Fenster mit Blick nach Westen…“ auf Booking.com trifft sicherlich nur auf die Zimmer in den oberen Etagen zu.

Somewhat like going back in time to an exquisitely decorated house with many tastefully decorated rooms.

From the moment we checked in we felt really comfortable and at home.

Our room was spacious, which for hotel rooms now is unusual.  We had a very comfortable large bed, a table and comfortable chairs.

There was all manner of lighting options, a coffee machine and tea making facilities.

The bathroom was large with his and his sinks.  Beautiful products at the sinks and in the shower.

Breakfast for us was again perfect.  When you check in they go through fresh options which are delivered to your breakfast table every morning by the sweetest girls who run the breakfast show.

In the centre of the breakfast room are meats, cheeses, beautiful breads, cakes, cereals and a wealth of options.  Eggs can be ordered to your specification and the cheese, ham, tomatoes scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection.

There is very comfortable seating in the lobby and by the breakfast room and an honesty bar should you desire an aperitivo.

The position of the hotel is also perfect for the lovely areas of Chiado and Biaxa with the metro station a 5 minute walk.

Book this hotel and you will not be disappointed as for us as our first impression of Lisbon could not have been better.

We only spent 3 nights there but could have spent more and at some point will return.

Thank you Alecrim ao Chiado.

"2024-11-10","10.0","Lissabon ist unbedingt eine Reise wert - im Alecrim ao Chiado noch mehr!","Das Hotel ist traumhaft schön, perfekt gelegen und sehr zentral. Das Personal, von der Rezeption, über das Housekeeping bis zu den Frühstücksfeen ist super freundlich, super aufmerksam und super hilfsbereit - allesamt eine absolute 10/10. Das Frühstück war sehr gut und man wird vorab gefragt, was man besonders gerne mag - das wird einem dann direkt an den Tisch gebracht. Die Eier werden in vielerlei Varianten auf Wunsch zubereitet und waren sehr lecker. Ich hatte für meine Frau zum Geburtstag vor der Anreise eine Torte und eine Flasche Sekt bestellt und es wurde morgens mit einem kleinen Ständchen an den Frühstückstisch gebracht. Perfekt - absolut perfekt. Wenn Lissabon, dann definitiv wieder ins Alecrim ao Chiado, denn das macht den Aufenthalt in Lissabon noch schöner.

Negative: Das einzige kleine Manko - das Zimmer Nummer 10 - eigentlich eine Suite - hat ein sehr überschaubares Bad. Wir stellten uns beispielsweise die Frage, wie man in die Dusche kommt, wenn man ein wenig ""beleibter"" ist. Die Matratzen sind sehr fest - das muss man mögen. Ansonsten war das Zimmer wirklich sehr schön und geräumig. Alles in allem aber ist das jammern auf sehr hohem Niveau und hat uns die Freude am Hotel nicht genommen.","","booking"

It feels more like a holiday house than your traditional/ impersonal hotel. The staffs at the hotel are exceedingly lovely and helpful. 

I must comment on the hotel breakfast. Whilst some reviews note the breakfast to be limited, we have the opposite experience. We found the breakfast to be excellent! It has reasonable variety. Most importantly, each item was of high quality. For example, they provided home made yogurt, homemade pastry and freshly cut fruit salad each morning, in addition to other buffet options. We have found the quality of breakfast to be better than other 5 stars hotels we’ve stayed in. I highly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to come back again!","Dear Yu,

Negative: The room was on the lower ground level which meant walking up and down some stairs to get to it but more importantly the thing that disappointed me the most was the fact that it has a window towards the street behind and  the room was ground floor level from that side, due to the city’s hilly nature, so people on that street could see straight into my room and I had to have my curtains closed almost all the time - I took a long time going through the photos on the site to choose a room which is not on the lower / ground level so am disappointed that this room was given to me and the hotel did not offer an alternative when I went to discuss this issue with them after I saw the room - the room given to me was not in the photos provided to the booking site and those rooms seemed to be on higher levels and had more privacy - the breakfast room was nicely presented but it was in a windowless area just opposite my room so in a way in the basement area and could near cars driving on top sometimes - the shower was in the middle of the room and the blind that was provided to give a bit of privacy did not work which was an issue since people in the street could see in the room - had to have the curtains drawn when showering anyway cause when I came out of the shower people could see me also - anyways just saying based on reviews I was expecting more from this hotel and was slightly disappointed although the decoration was lovely and to my taste but I don’t believe I would stay there again because of these issues unless they can guarantee a room on the higher floors maybe","Dear Narmin,

"2025-07-02","10.0","Lovely Staff, Property and Great Location","The room was spotless, very comfortable bed, great shower pressure plenty of hot water and lovely toiletries. As the temps outside were 97-104 degrees, A/C was critical and it kept the room very comfortable. Included breakfast was wonderful, with an attentive staff who also make omelets to order. Claudia pays close attention to detail, which no doubt accounts for how impeccable the property is.  Loved “By the Wine” on backstreet Ruas das Flores with great atmosphere, food, wine variety and just steps from our room. On a busy street, but didn’t find it noisy.  Ideal location with short walk to the river, train station, Pink Street and Rossio Square.  Secured building and in an area that felt very safe to us. We were with a larger group that stayed at a more expensive hotel and after seeing their property we were so happy we chose Alecrim.

Negative: The staff never made it seem bothersome, but instead of having them take time out of their busy schedule to fill water bottles, it would be nice to have a filtered water station where we could have poured our own water.  It was 95+ degrees outside during our stay and one morning we left before the staff arrived so were not able to fill our bottles.","Dear Valerie,
Thank you so much for your wonderful and detailed review! We’re thrilled to hear that you had such a comfortable stay and appreciated the cleanliness of the room, the powerful shower, the efficient A/C, and our breakfast service — including the omelets made to order. Your kind words about Claudia and the attention to detail truly mean a lot to us.

"2025-12-12","7.0","Decent, but room for improvement.","The location, the boutique feel, and the breakfast was nice. Sameer stayed and waited for us for our late check in ( 9:30PM) because our flight was delayed. He is an amazing polite, respectful young man. By far he was the reason our stay was enjoyable.

Negative: We got a deluxe suite, and there was no minibar, or chested drawers.The shower was licking as well.
Also my husband wanted to work on his laptop in the waiting hidden area of the lobby, and the cleaning lady, said he was not allowed to be there because she wanted to clean the carpets. When husband went to the front desk and ask the lady up front about the situation ( don’t know her name, but she had short curly hair), she didn’t seem of much of help.
She was not friendly at all. Seems like they rather clean the carpet, than let the guesses work in the laptop for 30 minutes while there were people resting in the suite.","Dear Diana,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we are pleased to hear that you appreciated our location, boutique atmosphere, breakfast, and especially Sameer’s exceptional professionalism and dedication during your late check-in, we would also like to address the concerns you raised.

Regarding the minibar, we would like to clarify that we do not offer a minibar, and this information is clearly stated on Booking.com. As for the leaking shower, we sincerely apologize. We always strive to pay close attention to details, and in this case, we fell short.

We also apologize for the inconvenience experienced in the lobby. Our guests are always our priority. We are confident that our colleagues did not intend to cause any inconvenience, as our staff is well known for being kind and accommodating. We believe this was a misunderstanding; however, we sincerely apologize for the situation.
The matter has been addressed internally, and action has been taken to ensure guests are always prioritized and treated with respect.

We appreciate you bringing this to our attention and regret that these issues impacted your stay.

Wishing you Happy Holidays!

Warm regards,

Claudia Carmo

"2025-09-26","6.0","","The hotel itself was charming; however, the room we were given was right next to the front desk on the first floor, facing a busy street. We could hear conversations from the front desk, which made it feel like we had little privacy. Unfortunately, someone had also left the windows open before our arrival, and we didn’t realize it until later. We stayed for two nights, but both the first night and the following day were very noisy due to loud street noise — people talking and shouting, likely from nearby bars — which made it extremely difficult to relax and sleep. Breakfast was okay, but overall, I had a poor experience and wouldn’t choose to stay here again.","Dear Shiho, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're truly sorry to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations and that your stay was impacted by noise from both the street and our front desk area. We understand how important a quiet and restful environment is for our guests, and we regret that we fell short in this regard during your visit. We also apologize for the oversight with the windows being left open prior to your arrival.That is certainly not the standard we strive to uphold. Please know that your comments have been shared with our team so we can take steps to ensure similar issues do not occur in the future. While we’re glad you found the hotel charming and breakfast acceptable, we are disappointed to learn that these aspects were not enough to improve your overall impression.
